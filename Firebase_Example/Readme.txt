    I a having trouble importing firebase CDN.

        The problem that students are having here is htat this tutorial was made in 2018.  Firebase has evolved and changed.  Therefore the form
        of things will look a little different. One example is that NetNinja is using Firebase 5 and we are using firebase 7. 

        Also, you will notice that we include the analytics, even though we are not knowingly using it. 

        This is a common situation when using tools such as firebase.  If we connect this to the IB exam this is is a great talking point for for 
        many of the ideas in teh course.  INcluding, CDN (benefits and drawbacks), managing documentation. 
    
    A similar situaiton will appear when you are in video 18.  When this video was done node 8 was the common versions, Node is now at version 12. If 
    using a version of Node greater than 8 you have to setup your billing information.  You won't actually get billed, but this is a requirement. 
    The other option is to install Node 8, but this option is being removed February.

            Node 8, if you just installed it you have node 12. You will have tools
            A)  (Okay) - Install and run using node 8.  
            B)  (Easier and Better) - Go to settings on your account and select add a credit card on the 
                account.  You won't get charged because you won't exceed data usage
